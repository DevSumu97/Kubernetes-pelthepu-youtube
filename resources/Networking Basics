🌐 What Is an IP Address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network.

📦 IPv4 Structure
An IPv4 address is 32 bits, divided into 4 octets (8 bits each)
→ Each number (0–255) is 8 bits.
Exponent (n)	Expression	Result
2⁰	1	✅ (anything to the power 0 = 1)
2¹	2	
2²	4	
2³	8	
2⁴	16	
2⁵	32	
2⁶	64	
2⁷	128

It has two parts:
Network portion — identifies the network. Network Bit is represented by 1
Host portion — identifies the device in that network. Host Bit is represented by 0

CIDR- Represents the Network Bits (Slash notation showing network bits)
In Class - A -> 1 network octet  -> 8 bits , Default CIDR of Class A /8 , If any thing more than 8 means subnetting is happened
In Class - B -> 2 network octets -> 16 bits, Default CIDR of Class B /16 , If any thing more than 16 means subnetting is happened
In Class - C -> 3 network octets -> 24 bits, Default CIDR of Class C /24 , If any thing more than 24 means subnetting is happened

Subnet Mask - Change the network bit to 255 and host bit to 0
Network ID- In the IP keep the Network bit as it is and change the host bit to 0
Broadcast ID - In the IP keep the Network bit as it is and change the host bit to 255

NO of usable IP address, Usable IPs=2^(number of host bits) −2
In -2 one is Network ID & the other is Broadcast ID 
The first address of a subnet = Network ID
The last address of a subnet = Broadcast Address

 🧠 Quick Trick
You can find usable IPs/hosts instantly from the CIDR:
Usable ip = (2^(32 - CIDR)) - 2     OR     Usable ip = (2^Host Bits) - 2  

Subnetting 
Subnetting means dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets).
Barrowing Host Bit to Network bit.

🧩 The Goal
We’re given how many hosts we need per subnet —
and we must find:
# The subnet mask (/CIDR)
# The number of subnets
# The usable IP range

🧮 Example 1 — Class C Network (192.168.1.0/24) Requirement: 20 hosts per subnet

Step 1 → Formula  2^h − 2 ≥ 20
Try values:
2⁴ − 2 = 14 ❌ (too few)
2⁵ − 2 = 30 ✅ (enough)
So h = 5

Step 2 → New Prefix
192.168.1.0 => In Class-C 3 network bit and 1 host bit N|N|N|H
Convert Host Bit to Binary 
192.168.1.00000000 <= COUNT 5 (h=5) from this direction & handover the rest of the bits to Network
192.168.1.11100000 ( Network bit is represented by 1 and host bit is represented by 0)
 Conver into decimal value  (128+64+32=224)
192.168.1.224/27  

New Prefix => 32−5=27 => IP4 is 32 bit in this 5 bits is host bit, So now we have 27 bits with network

2⁷  2⁶ 2⁵ 2⁴ 2³ 2² 2¹ 2⁰    		✅ (anything to the power 0 = 1)
128 64 32 16 8  4  2  1

✅ New subnet mask = 255.255.255.224 (/27)    Note: Subnet Mask - Change the network bit to 255 and host bit to 0

Step 3 → Number of Subnets
==========================
We borrowed 3 bits (from /24 → /27) 2^3=8 subnets

Step 4 → Block Size
==================
256−224=32
So each subnet has 32 addresses.

Step 5 → Subnets and Ranges
| Subnet | Network ID   | Broadcast     | Usable Range                 | Usable Hosts |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |

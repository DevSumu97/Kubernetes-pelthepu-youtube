🌐 What Is an IP Address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network.

📦 IPv4 Structure
An IPv4 address is 32 bits, divided into 4 octets (8 bits each)
→ Each number (0–255) is 8 bits.
Exponent (n)	Expression	Result
2⁰	1	✅ (anything to the power 0 = 1)
2¹	2	
2²	4	
2³	8	
2⁴	16	
2⁵	32	
2⁶	64	
2⁷	128

It has two parts:
Network portion — identifies the network. Network Bit is represented by 1
Host portion — identifies the device in that network. Host Bit is represented by 0

| Class | Range                       | Default Subnet Mask | Private IP                      | Use             | Network/Host | Default CIDR  |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **A** | 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255   | 255.0.0.0           | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255       | Large networks  | N|H|H|H      | /8            |
| **B** | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0         | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255     | Medium networks | N|N|H|H      | /16           |

| **E** | 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 | N/A                 | —                               | Experimental    |              |               |

CIDR- Represents the Network Bits 
In Class - A -> 1 network octet  -> 8 bits , Default CIDR of Class A /8 , If any thing more than 8 means subnetting is happened
In Class - B -> 2 network octets -> 16 bits, Default CIDR of Class B /16 , If any thing more than 16 means subnetting is happened
In Class - C -> 3 network octets -> 24 bits, Default CIDR of Class C /24 , If any thing more than 24 means subnetting is happened

Subnet Mask - Change the network bit to 255 and host bit to 0
Network ID- In the IP keep the Network bit as it is and change the host bit to 0
Broadcast ID - In the IP keep the Network bit as it is and change the host bit to 255

NO of usable IP address, Usable IPs=2^(number of host bits) −2
In -2 one is Network ID & the other is Broadcast ID 
The first address of a subnet = Network ID
The last address of a subnet = Broadcast Address

| 255.255.255.255 | /32  | 0         | 1               | 0 (single host address)                 |

 🧠 Quick Trick
You can find usable IPs instantly from the CIDR:
Usable = (2^(32 - CIDR)) - 2
